# Changes Made - AI Manuscript Editor

This document tracks all changes made to the codebase during development.

## Step 1 - Streamlit UI (minimal first) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **STARTED**: Creating basic Streamlit UI with sidebar and main area
- Created `changes-made.md` to track progress
- Created `requirements.txt` with initial dependencies (streamlit, openai, PyPDF2, python-docx, reportlab)
- Created `app.py` with complete Streamlit UI:
  - Sidebar with password field for OPENAI_API_KEY
  - File uploader for PDF/DOCX files
  - "Begin Processing" button
  - Main area with st.status & st.progress placeholders
  - Input disabling logic during processing
  - Session state management

## Step 2 - Document Ingestion ‚úÖ COMPLETED (minus testing)
- **COMPLETED**: Document ingestion functionality
- Created `document_ingestion.py` with complete text extraction:
  - `detect_file_type()` - Detects PDF/DOCX file types
  - `extract_text_from_pdf()` - Extracts text from PDF bytes preserving \n
  - `extract_text_from_docx()` - Extracts text from DOCX bytes preserving \n
  - `extract_document_text()` - Main function combining both extractors
  - Error handling and success flags for robust extraction
- Created test infrastructure (skipped actual testing per user request):
  - Sample journal text fixture
  - Test fixture generation script
  - Comprehensive unit test suite

## Step 3 - Chunking Engine (docs-driven) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **COMPLETED**: Chunking engine with improved regex and structured output
- Created `chunking_engine.py` adapted from docs/chunk-logic.md:
  - Implemented improved regex: `DAY_RE = re.compile(r'^\s*Day\s+(\d+)\b.*', re.I)`
  - Returns List[dict] objects: `{"day": <int>, "text": <full_entry_with_header>}`
  - Added utility functions: `get_chunk_count()`, `get_chunk_summary()`
  - Includes test function for debugging
- Integrated chunking into main Streamlit app:
  - Document text extraction and chunking in processing workflow
  - Chunk count logging to sidebar (as specified in project plan)
  - Visual display of parsed entries with previews
  - Error handling for documents without day entries
  - Session state management for chunks and extracted text

## Step 4 - Batched Editing via OpenAI ‚úÖ COMPLETED (with refinement)
- **COMPLETED**: AI-powered editing using gpt-4.5-preview model
- Created `openai_editor.py` with comprehensive editing functionality:
  - System prompt loaded from docs/openai-api.md at runtime (1-liner file read)
  - Uses gpt-4.5-preview model (overriding user rules as specified)
  - No context history - just system + user messages
  - Temperature 0.43, max_completion_tokens 16,384, top_p 1
  - Batch size = 4 chunks (fits token window + keeps UI responsive)
  - Exponential backoff retry logic for status ‚â• 500 or RateLimitError
  - Results stored in list with order preserved
  - **REFINEMENT**: Now accepts custom system prompt parameter
- Integrated AI editing into Streamlit app:
  - "‚ú® Edit with AI" button appears after successful document parsing
  - Real-time progress tracking with batch status messages
  - Enhanced entry display showing AI-edited vs original content
  - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
  - Session state management for edited chunks and completion status
  - **REFINEMENT**: Added editable system prompt in sidebar:
    - Loads default from docs/openai-api.md into resizable text area
    - Users can customize editing instructions before processing
    - "üîÑ Reset to Default" button to restore original prompt
    - Uses user's edited prompt (if modified) or default for AI processing

## Step 5 - Re-assembly & Export ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **COMPLETED**: PDF generation and download functionality
- Created `pdf_generator.py` with comprehensive PDF generation:
  - Concatenates edited chunks with two blank lines between days (as specified)
  - Uses ReportLab to create simple PDF with single style, A4 portrait format
  - In-memory bytes generation (no disk I/O) for direct download
  - Professional formatting with custom title, day headers, and body styles
  - Automatic text escaping for ReportLab compatibility
  - Smart filename generation based on day range
  - PDF statistics calculation (entries, words, estimated pages)
- Integrated PDF export into Streamlit app:
  - "üì• Download PDF" button appears after AI editing completion
  - PDF preview statistics in sidebar (entries, words, pages)
  - st.download_button with in-memory bytes (no disk I/O as specified)
  - Proper MIME type and suggested filename
  - Final completion dashboard with metrics and enhancement summary
  - Error handling for PDF generation issues
  - User-friendly success messaging and download instructions

## Step 6 - UX Polish ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **COMPLETED**: Enhanced user experience with professional status messages and error handling
- Enhanced status messages as specified in project plan:
  - "Parsed ‚úì ‚Äî 38 entries" format for successful document parsing
  - "Sending batch 3/10 ‚Ä¶" format during AI processing batches  
  - "Done ‚Äî generating PDF" completion status
  - st.status() components with proper expanded/collapsed states
- Comprehensive error handling with st.error() banners:
  - Document extraction failures with detailed troubleshooting
  - Journal entry parsing errors with format requirements
  - AI editing failures with API key and rate limit guidance
  - PDF generation errors with retry instructions
- Partial progress data retention as specified:
  - Settings preserved across all error scenarios
  - Users can retry without re-uploading documents
  - Parsed entries maintained during AI editing failures
  - Enhanced entries preserved during PDF generation issues
- Additional UX enhancements:
  - "üîÑ Retry AI Editing" button for failed processing
  - Context-aware status messages based on current step
  - Detailed error solutions and troubleshooting guidance
  - Consistent error messaging format throughout app

## Step 7 - Documentation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive project documentation and deployment readiness
- Created comprehensive README.md file:
  - Feature overview and quick start guide
  - Detailed installation and usage instructions
  - Document format requirements and examples
  - Technical architecture and component descriptions
  - Development setup and testing procedures
  - Troubleshooting guide with common issues
  - Performance metrics and privacy information
  - Contributing guidelines and support information
- Optimized .gitignore file:
  - Python-specific exclusions (__pycache__, *.pyc, etc.)
  - Virtual environment directories (env/, venv/, etc.)
  - IDE configurations (.vscode/, .idea/, etc.)
  - Security sensitive files (*.key, .env, secrets.json)
  - OS-specific files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db, etc.)
  - Application-specific exclusions (test PDFs, uploads, etc.)
  - Streamlit configuration files
- Verified and optimized requirements.txt:
  - All necessary dependencies confirmed and categorized
  - Version constraints specified for stability
  - Comments added for clarity and maintenance
  - Confirmed compatibility with Python 3.8+
