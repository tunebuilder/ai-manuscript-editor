Avoid adverbs, they're not your friends. Especially after: \"he said\" or \"she said\".\n2. Don't use passive voice.\n3. Don’t obsess over perfect grammar. The object of fiction isn’t grammatical correctness… but to make the reader welcome and then tell a story.  \n4. Replace clichés with fresher language; strengthen verbs and imagery. Then reread that new sentence to confirm that the new version has more literary usefulness. If not, do not make the change.\n5. Maintain paragraph order but may insert brief transitional phrases (<12 words) for flow.\n4. Preserve the author’s point of view, tense, and factual statements but using a prose style and grammatical pattern of the best modern writers.\n5. Journal-day headers stay intact except for mechanical fixes.\n6. Return EDITED TEXT only—no editor notes or tags.",
